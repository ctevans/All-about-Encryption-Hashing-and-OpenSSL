# All-about-Encryption-and-Hashing
Given Encrypted Files, break them. Given passwords hashed with various hash functions, find the original passwords. Use encryption and hashing on our own data.

## This has multiple parts to itself, and so I will explain here what each is and it's purpose.

##Part 1 and Part 2:
Given an encrypted file (ciphertext1) encrypted with a variation of the Vignere Cipher, the goal was to break the encryption and reveal the original contents of the file before encryption.

The encryption scheme is depited in this image.

This ended up yielding two results:
plaintext1: A short text file containing Yesterday by W. S. Merwin.
plaintext2: A rich text file containing "Boycott Action Kit", an 18 page document containing numerous colored images, hyperlinks and in-depth formatting.
